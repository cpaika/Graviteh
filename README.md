Graviteh
========

Graviteh is a simple Java game where you explore and conquer space, using realistic physics.  I came up with the idea after playing games such as Kerbal Space Program, N-Ball, and other 2d and 3d games involving gravitational physics.

Summary:  You start with one planet, and using sattelites and spaceships you attempt to subjugate the universe to your will, exploring, establishing vital communication links, conquering other planets in the name of your empire and defeating the other AI players in your celestial neighborhood.
