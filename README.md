Graviteh
========

Graviteh is a gravitational attraction simulation, implemented in Java with Swing Java Graphics.  Its current functionality is very basic, with hopes to add in gameplay elements as the code becomes more refined.

Currently the game starts with a screen filled with gravitational bodies orbiting a central body with a relatively large mass.  The user can click on the screen to create a body, zoom in and out with their mouse wheel as well as use the arrow keys to change the velocity of the body starting in the center of the screen.
